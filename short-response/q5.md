# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
3. `/products/5` matches the `/products/:id` because it provides a specific id number that will render that specific id's data.



# Feedback

Although you are correct, one can also argue that products/apple will also match the path. When designing paths and going to them one should look at the pattern of the path!
